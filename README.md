# sol-mov
Using the multiple extreme ultraviolet (EUV) filters of the AIA instrument on board the SDO spacecraft, we can gaze at the solar atmosphere in a variety of wavelengths and temperatures of emitting plasma. This script will search through the virual solar observatory (VSO) for a corresponding range of data, download, and process this data to generate the output movie.

# To-do list
- Pull HMI data as an additional source for visualization
- Perhaps tidy the filter masks around the visible disk rather than the image boundaries...
